/**

/**
 * All tunables + model locations for [AsrKwsService]. Model files are NOT
 * committed: they are downloaded to app storage at first run (URLs + install
 * paths in the README) and their absolute directories are passed here.
 *
 * @property language Which streaming model to load (FR or EN).
 * @property asrModelDir Absolute dir of the streaming zipformer model
 *   (`encoder.onnx` / `decoder.onnx` / `joiner.onnx` / `tokens.txt`).
 * @property vadModelPath Absolute path to the Silero VAD onnx used to gate ASR.
 * @property kwsModelDir Absolute dir of the KeywordSpotter model
 *   (`encoder/decoder/joiner` + `tokens.txt`, streaming zipformer KWS).
 * @property wakeWords Human-readable wake phrase(s) (e.g. "hey mlomega"). Encoded
 *   to the sherpa keywords format (token ids per line) by [KeywordEncoder] and
 *   written to a keywords file the KeywordSpotter loads.
 * @property sampleRate AudioRecord sample rate (sherpa streaming models are 16k).
 * @property numThreads onnxruntime intra-op threads (2 keeps latency low on S25).
 * @property provider onnxruntime execution provider ("cpu" is the safe default;
 *   "nnapi" can be enabled once validated on device).
 * @property ownMicrophone E47-A. false (default) → the service consumes PCM
 *   pushed through [AsrKwsService.asPcmSink] by the WebRTC transport fan-out (the
 *   single-microphone arbitration path; no `AudioRecord` here). true → legacy
 *   E26 path where the service opens its own `AudioRecord` (device-standalone, no
 *   WebRTC). Two concurrent microphones are forbidden, so this is only ever true
 *   when the transport is NOT capturing.
 * @property commandWindowMs E47-A. How long (ms) the wake word keeps the command
 *   window open: final transcripts ending inside it are flagged `isCommand=true`
 *   for PC-side routing. Capture never stops — this only gates routing.
